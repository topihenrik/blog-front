# Frontend App for the Blog Project
This is the repository for the frontend of the blog project. Frontend is split into two repositories: Blog Front and Blog Edit. Link to the other repository can be seen below. The original idea was to create blog website that has two distinct frontend react applications and one backend express.js api that manages the persistent data. This separation was created so that the developer learns how to create a web applications that have independent frontend and backend code.
